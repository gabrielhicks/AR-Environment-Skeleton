# AR-Environment-Skeleton

You can use this repo to build new Activerecord projects

* You will need to create your own app/models directories

Answer the following questions in the README:
Which method(s) does Active Record create for you?
- It creates .all method, also attributes are accessible if accessed through User.first.first_name, or using a find query. Was unable to set variable names in my seeds.rb and am confused why rake would populate a table, but not let me access user information via these variables.

Which method(s) did you have to create yourself? Why? -->

tenure, and full name and all in grade. I technically could have accessed these through chainged queries and manipulation, but as far as a one shot method call they are not available
